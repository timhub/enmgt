Insourced?

内雇，不是把我们的活儿弄去墨西哥…
Insourced. Instead of exporting our jobs to Mexico...

72
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,928
而是把墨西哥人弄来干我们的活儿
they're importing Mexicans to take our jobs.

73
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:28,994
你就是个傻子，知道吗？

85
00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:12,245

看起来我的牙白多了 像是到第八格了
I think I picked up a couple shades. Looks like an eight.

87
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:22,447

他们散布谣言，我们传播理想
They sling mud, we sling ideas.

00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:54,428
为什么投票很重要

143
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:57,267
很多勇敢的战士牺牲生命
Many brave soldiers sacrificed themselves.

144
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,202
我们理所应得的权利
A right we take for granted.

145
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:01,799
- 为民权 - 为民治
- For the people. - By the people.

146
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:03,976
我们是民众！

148
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:10,379
世界上所有伟大的文明都遵循同样的规律

149
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:14,348
从被奴役到自由 从自由到富裕…
From bondage, to liberty, from liberty to abundance...

150
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:18,652
从富裕到自满 从自满到冷漠…
from abundance to complacency. From complacency to apathy...

151
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:21,053
从冷漠再回到被奴役
from apathy back to bondage.

152
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,032
如果我们不想被历史所左右 我们就必须打破这个怪圈
If we're to be the exception to history, then we must break the cycle.

153
00:12:25,768 --> 00:12:29,260
因为人一旦忘却历史 就注定将重蹈覆辙
For those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

154
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,434

169
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:19,283
巴德去哪儿了？

170

171
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:26,689

新墨西哥州历来都是决定结果的关键

210
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:37,783
夫人 你昨晚有没有在德士古镇投票站投票？
Madam, did you cast your vote at a Texico polling station last night?

211
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:40,111
我早上投的
I voted in the morning.

212
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,157

没，没有，抱歉打扰你了

215
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,522
太令人震惊了 除了新墨西哥州，根据各州的情况...
It is amazing. With every state but New Mexico reporting...

216
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,290
美国总统竞选之争已进入白热化
we're now in a dead heat for the American presidency.

217
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:54,425
每位候选人几乎得到了同样的票数
Each candidate with virtually the same amount of electoral votes.

218
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:58,440
270票，获胜的神奇数字 真是精采绝伦！
270, the magic number to win. This is a real photo finish!

219
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,704
谁能在该州赢得普选投票
And it goes to whoever wins the popular vote in the state.

220
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:03,505
所有五张选举团票都将归于该党

221
00:22:03,578 --> 00:22:05,814
噢，该州再不是无用的迷人之地了

222
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:08,408
谁能赢得新墨西哥州 谁就能赢得白宫
Whoever takes New Mexico, takes the White House.

223
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:13,716
再一次让我们有了似曾相识的感觉 2000年的大选将由达德郡来决定
It's deja vu again. 2000 presidential election came down to Dade County.

224
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:18,860
总数一亿五百万张选票 由佛罗里达州的四百张来决定输赢
400 votes in the state of Florida, out of a total of 105 million cast.

225
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,627
如果被证明是平局 任何一名候选人都不能赢得多数
If this is a certified tie, neither the candidate would receive the majority.

226
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:27,494
历史上有过处理这种场面的总统吗？
Do we even have a president to deal with this?

227
00:22:27,636 --> 00:22:30,772
依据第十二次修正案 结果将由众议院来决定
Pursuant to the 12th amendment, the House of Representatives would decide.

228
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:32,707
自从约翰・昆西・亚当斯在1824年击败安德鲁・杰克逊以来
That hasn't happened since...

229
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:37,474
还从未发生过
John Quincy Adams defeated Andrew Jackson back in 1824.

230
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:39,170
那就是说是历史罕见了
We're talking rare.

231
00:22:39,447 --> 00:22:42,610
难道 这不是给全国人民的一次最好的公民教育吗？
No, this isn't a great civics lesson to the people of this country?

232
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:47,822
如果新墨西哥州有人没有投票的话 他现在肯定很后悔
If anyone in New Mexico didn't vote, he be kicking themselves right now.

233
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:52,452
最新消息 柯里郡的结果还是很接近分不出胜负
The latest reports coming in, Curry County still too close to call.

234
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,519
这次选举的结果将由一个小郡来决定 这可能吗？
This election is down to a single county. Is this even possible?

235
00:22:57,699 --> 00:23:01,465
听着，约翰 德士古镇只有653名注册选民
Listen, John, there's only 653 registered voters in Texico.

236
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:03,163
选票他们已经重新数过了
And they've already recounted those votes.

237
00:23:03,238 --> 00:23:06,935
我知道 有这消息再加一美金，我都能买条船了
I know. With that information and a dollar, I could buy a chalupa!

238
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:09,543
我认识的投了票的人都被打过电话了
Everyone I know who voted has been personally called.

239
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:11,503
那又怎样？
So what?

240
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:14,304
所以，选举结果 事实是将由柯里郡来决定…
So, the election. The fact that it's down to Curry County...

241
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:16,583
这跟德士古镇有关
it has something to do with Texico.

242
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:19,519
噢，天哪，等会儿打给你！
Oh my God. Call you back!

243
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,469
巴德！

God, my head!

246

What? What time is it?

247
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:54,286
有人要见你
There's some people here to see you.

248
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:56,051
有人？
Some people?

249
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:58,052
看样子是政府的
They look official.

250
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:04,263
- 儿童福利会的？ - 我猜是的
- Child services? - That's what I'm thinking.

251
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:18,145
- 好了 - 走吧
- Okay. - Here we go.

252
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:26,748
约翰逊先生，我们应该先打电话的 但是你没有电话
Mr. Johnson, we would have called first, but you don't have a telephone.

噢，没有，没有，我们有电话的
No, no, no, we got a phone.

254
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:34,662

It's just not connected right now. But I'm on it, you know.

255
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:37,654
自从老婆走了以后 不得不说有些困难，但是…
I'm not gonna say it's been easy since the wife left, but...

256
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:40,027
- 我们过的很好 - 当然
- we're getting on fine. - Sure are.

257
00:24:40,235 --> 00:24:45,537
而且，我会付清这些帐单的，我保证 只要我找到新工作
And I'm gonna pay these off, I swear. Just as soon as I find a new job.

258
00:24:45,707 --> 00:24:47,766
- 新工作？ - 是的
- A new job? - Yes.

259
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:53,081
我以前是威利・纳尔森乐队的 我在想…
I used to be in this Willy Nelson tribute band. I was thinking about...

260
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:57,882
等贝司手假释出来以后 再把大伙儿召集起来
getting the guys back together again, soon as our bass player gets paroled.

261
00:24:58,186 --> 00:25:00,984
还有喝酒，我知道 我知道这看起来不好
And the drinking, I know it, I know it looks bad.

262
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:04,890
戒酒已经是我的头号任务了
And licking that sucker is at the top of my list.

263
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:07,953
请不要带走我女儿
Please don't take away from me.

264

你没犯事，不用请律师

但是，得进行宣誓

00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:18,710
你怎么就不能不要多管闲事呢？

跟你说了这对我很重要 但是你从来都不听！
I told you this was important to me, but you never listen!

It's an anomaly.

324
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:14,773
别废话，拉里！ 是哪个投票站的机器？

好吧，孩子们，开始战斗吧

We can't do that legally.

335

00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,114
今天本来要学习果冻的细胞质的
We were supposed to my cytoplasm out of Jell-O today.

337
00:29:55,817 --> 00:29:58,586
宁愿坐在破烂的教室里，也不愿出来…
What kinda kid would rather sit in a crummy classroom...

338
00:29:58,586 --> 00:29:59,951
有这样的小孩吗？

339
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:03,913
不去找工作，而坐在这里钓鱼，有这样的老爸吗？

真新鲜！
How refreshing!

346
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:27,742
老天！你能不能不要总是那么聪明？
Jesus! You gotta quit being such a smart ass all the time?

347
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:30,784
你不要老是拿耶稣当脏话！
And you've got to stop using Jesus as a cuss word all the time!

348
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,054
他可是无数人的救世主
He's a billion people's Savior.

349
00:30:33,054 --> 00:30:35,147
好，行了吧，行不？ 我不说了

00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,707
不是，她…不是，她不能

359
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:25,933
我没工作你不感到难堪吗？
It's not gonna embarrass you that I don't have a job?

360
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:27,567
我不在乎

去把车发动

是的，我想问你几个问题

你知道吗，你比电视上还好看

377
00:32:52,293 --> 00:32:55,922
别误会，你在电视上也很漂亮
Don't get me wrong, you're pretty on the TV too.

378
00:32:57,131 --> 00:32:59,463
只是，我们的电视太旧把你“挤”扁了
Just, we got an old set that kinda "squirshes" you.

379
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:00,430

380
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:03,004
我知道了，约翰逊先生，我肯定…
I believe, Mr. Johnson. I believe...

00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:08,542
巴德，我希望你能告诉我为什么那些人…

深夜从圣达菲飞过来见你

呃，事实上，我保证过要保密的
Well, actually, I kinda promised to keep that a secret.

385
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:26,216
你是说，你会去重新投票
You mean, you're going to recast your vote.

386
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:31,565
呃，他妈的，我猜这根本不是什么秘密了
Well, shit, I guess that I guess it ain't that much of a secret then.

387
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,961
呃，听着，巴德 你需要注意你的用词
Now, listen, Bud, you need to watch your language.

388
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:37,263
- 我们会放到电视上去的，好吗？ -  用词？
- We're taping this for TV, okay? - The language?

389
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:40,907
他妈的，噢当然！

390
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:46,446
我要问的是，你之前投给了谁 现在是否也一样？
The question now is, who you voted for and are you going to vote the same way?

391
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:50,547
再提醒我一下谁在竞选？
Remind me again who's running?

392
00:33:51,485 --> 00:33:54,477
那么也就是说，你还没有决定？
What you're saying is, you're keeping an open mind?

393
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:57,354
是，那个…
Yeah, that's...

394
00:33:57,858 --> 00:33:59,155
我就是那种人
That's the kinda guy I am.

395
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:01,050
你在开玩笑吧！
You gotta be kidding me!

00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:03,754
这是条大新闻，头号新闻！
This is OJ big. Bigger!

还以为我会一直待在这个鬼地方
I thought I was gonna die in this shithole.

你答应过只要时机合适，会给我机会的 现在时机来了！
You said that when the time was right, you'd give me a chance. That's the time!

401
00:34:16,143 --> 00:34:17,303
我们又要重回新闻市场了
We'll be back to a real market.

I got the tape of Mrs. Zachary's prize winning sow.

她去阿尔伯克基寻她的歌星梦去了

她会带我去巡回演出，给我任何东西

她很可能会在奥斯汀开演唱会

419
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:35,114

这名决定大选结果的关键选民

436
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,252
那些急于想知道结果的人 可能会非常失望了

437
00:36:50,464 --> 00:36:53,695
因为你们将要见到一个注册的独立选民…
Because you are about to meet a registered independent...

438
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:56,632
说他还未做决定

439
00:36:57,404 --> 00:37:00,100
想象下，在这个人的肩上…
Imagine, on this man's shoulders...

440
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:03,242
承载着自由世界的未来

441
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:05,044
我就是那种人
Just the kind of guy I am.

442
00:37:06,947 --> 00:37:11,247
让我们再也别说，一张票没有意义了
Let it never again be said, that a single vote counts for nothing.

443
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:21,785
巴德！
Bud!

444
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,119
巴德！
Bud!

445
00:37:24,265 --> 00:37:24,890
干嘛？

外面有人
There's some people outside.

447
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:31,998
老天，你不要再这样子搞醒我了，好不好？
Geez, you gotta stop waking me up like this, okay?

448
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:33,734
这样会吓死我的
You're gonna kill me.

449
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:36,105
外面有人！
There are some people outside!

450
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:38,306
人？
People?

451
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,344
老天！
God!

452
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,018
不是，不是那边！在前门外面！
No, not there! Out front!

453
00:37:45,753 --> 00:37:49,314
噢，天…干嘛呀这是？
Oh, God... What now?

454
00:37:51,525 --> 00:37:53,720
- 老爸，快点！ - 是的，我在走，宝贝
- Dad, hurry up! - Yeah, I'm going, honey.

455
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,220
外面有很多人

456
00:37:58,532 --> 00:38:02,093
好的，宝贝 我们看看外面有什么大不了的
Okay, honey, let's see what the fuss is all about.

457
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,468
那是他吗？
Is that him?

458
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:09,270
巴德！
Bud!

459
00:38:10,344 --> 00:38:11,834
约翰逊先生，你做决定了吗？
Mr. Johnson, any decisions yet?

460
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:27,317
- 他妈的！ - 他们要干嘛？
- Holy shit! - What do they want?

461
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:29,961
我不知道
I don't know.

462
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:35,160
把电视打开，宝贝
Go turn the TV on, baby.

463
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:47,274
我们现在正处于历史性时刻

这名关键选民已经被确认

我们现在是在新墨西哥州德士古镇的 一辆拖车边做现场报道
We go live now to a trailer in Texico, New Mexico.

466
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:56,417
埃里斯特・约翰逊几分钟前现身了
Earnest Johnson made an appearance just moments ago.

467
00:38:56,724 --> 00:38:59,284
很显然，他被现场的媒体吓到了
Apparently, overwhelmed by the media presence.

468
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,487
兰德里先生 您认识埃里斯特・约翰逊先生有多久了？
And Mr. Landry, exactly how long have you known Earnest Johnson?

469
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:07,032
埃里斯特・约翰逊？ 嗨，埃里斯特！
Earnest Johnson? Hey, Earnest!

470
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:11,504
- 你是说巴德吗？ - 我们是一起长大的
- You mean Bud? - We all grew up together.

471
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:14,008
你们怎么看他将肩负…
How do you think he's shouldering the responsibility...

472
00:39:14,008 --> 00:39:16,476
挑选出下一届美国总统的重任？
of picking the next President of the United States?

473
00:39:18,612 --> 00:39:21,513
呃，我肯定…
Well, I'm sure that...

474
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:26,149
埃里斯特现在吓得都尿裤子了
Earnest is... crapping his pants.

475
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:31,792
他是个好人，他会好好选的
He's a good guy. He likes to treat them good.

476
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:33,817
我们曾经把车都给点着了！
We used to light the mesa back here on fire!

477
00:39:40,768 --> 00:39:42,065
都是我的错，是不是？
It's all my fault, isn't it?

478
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:44,366
不！不是，不是，不是，宝贝，不是你
No! No, no, no, baby, no.

479
00:39:44,938 --> 00:39:48,840
如果我没有让你失望的话这些也不会发生
None of this would have happened if I hadn't let you down.

480
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,270
我们该怎么办？
What are we gonna do?

481
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:52,838
呃…
Well...

482

我得回去见见这些人
I'm gonna back these people up.

483
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:06,016
他妈的！
Holy shit!

484
00:40:07,628 --> 00:40:08,652
太多了！
There's so many!

485
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:13,658
呃，我走出去，对吧？我…
Ok, I'm just gonna go out there, right? I'm gonna...

486
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:19,666
我出去告诉那些人不是我投的票
I'm gonna walk out there and tell those people it wasn't me who voted.

487
00:40:20,274 --> 00:40:21,536
不行，你不能说！
No, you can't!

488
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:22,876
为什么不行？
Why not?

489
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:25,438
你已经面对法官在圣经前发过誓了 承认是你做的一切
You swore to that judge, on a Bible and everything.

490
00:40:25,512 --> 00:40:27,742
什么？大半夜的，那不算数的！
What? That was the middle of the night. That can't count!

491
00:40:29,249 --> 00:40:32,548
你已经发誓了，巴德 选民欺诈是重罪
You were under oath, Bud. Voter fraud is a felony.

492
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:35,087
再犯一项罪 他们就会带走我
And one more felony and they take me away from you.

493
00:40:35,222 --> 00:40:37,213
你说的对，他妈的！ 我死定了！
You're right. Shit! I am down to one!

494
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:50,136
我们怎么办？
What do we do?

495
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:58,975
我们不得不撒谎了
We lie. We have to.

496
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:07,448
好吧，好主意 这只是个善意的谎话
Okay, that's a good plan. Just a little white lie is all this is.

497
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:09,751
- 只有我们知道 - 只有我们俩知道
- Between us. - Just between us.

498
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:13,485
谁知道呢，也许这事儿，所有这些…
Who knows, maybe this thing, all these...

499
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:18,654
也许这些人，他们会走的
Maybe all these people, they just go away.

500
00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:57,101
停下！停下！
Stop! Stop!

501
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:40,508
这是什么鬼地方？
What the hell is this?

502
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:42,414
这是我们能找到的最大的地方了
The biggest space we could find.

503
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:47,754
我们怎么做？ 围绕一个人来搞竞选？
How we gonna do this? Build a campaign around one man?

504
00:42:47,754 --> 00:42:50,154
- 我不知道该怎么做 - 交给我吧
- I don't know how to do this. - You're gonna leave it to me.

505
00:42:50,324 --> 00:42:53,088
我们能搞定他的，唐！ 我们会搞定这家伙的
We're gonna win him, Don! We're gonna win this guy.

506
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,562
我们让事情朝我们的方向发展！
We got the issues on our side!

507
00:42:55,562 --> 00:42:57,331
- 说得好！ - 他会喜欢我的！
- There you go! - He's gonna love me!

508
00:42:57,331 --> 00:42:58,525
为什么不呢？
What's not to love?

509
00:43:02,603 --> 00:43:06,733
我们有麻烦了 我要你挖出埃里斯特・约翰逊的所有资料
We're in trouble. I need you to dig up everything you can on Earnest Johnson.

510
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:08,275
跟他的家人聊，跟他的朋友聊
Talk to his family, his friends.

511
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:10,573
我要知道他读什么样的书 他看什么样的电视
I want to know what he reads, what television show he watches.

512
00:43:10,644 --> 00:43:15,104
他的爱好，偏好的食物 希望，梦想，所有的
His hobbies, his favorite foods, his hopes, his dreams, everything.

513
00:43:15,649 --> 00:43:19,983
所有需要做的就是赢得一个美国人的心！
All we have to do is win over one American mind!

514
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:21,779
你看，我只是在想，马蒂
You know, I was just thinking, Marty.

515
00:43:22,556 --> 00:43:24,683
我得认识这个约翰逊老兄，自己去
I'd like to get to know this Bud Johnson. Personally.

516
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:25,925
好，行
Okay. Good.

517
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,227
或许可以带他出去吃冰淇淋
Maybe take him out for some ice cream.

518
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:32,758
冰淇淋？
Ice cream?

519
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,361
哪个成年人不喜欢冰淇淋呢？
What grown man doesn't like ice cream?

520
00:43:39,172 --> 00:43:42,505
学历不高，连小学都没上多久
No higher education, not much lower education.

521
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:44,970
离了婚的单亲爸爸，最近刚被炒

522
00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:46,137
我们第一步行动是什么？
What's our first step?

523
00:43:46,313 --> 00:43:49,441
把你们弄到一起 看看你能不能说服他站在我们一边
Put you in a room together. See if you persuade him to come over to our side.

I like it. Him and me in a room. Yes, talking ideas, seeing what comes up.

00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:57,524
好计划，我会给你一些话题的
Great plan. I'll get you some talking points.

526
00:43:57,524 --> 00:43:59,082
我擅长即兴发挥
I'm good off the cuff already.

527
00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:04,097
当然拉！ 我们只是把各种各样的想法都集中起来
Of course! We're just gonna get an itty bitty think tank together.

528
00:44:04,097 --> 00:44:07,863
我们去查下资料 看看你们俩有什么共同话题

00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,440
我不想伤害你感情，你成不了泼拉・赞恩
I don't want to hurt your feelings, you're no Paula Zahn.

562
00:46:02,516 --> 00:46:03,574

好 那就是为什么这里的每个人都想踢走你的原因
Yes, that's why everybody here is trying to rip it out from under you.

565
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:14,082
你想在纽约有一席之地？ 你想在洛杉矶有一席之地？
You want a desk in New York, you want a desk in Los Angeles?

566
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:16,628
忘掉你在新闻学院学的东西吧
Forget everything you learned in journalism school.

567
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:21,700
那都不新了，不适应生活了 这个更大，现在是电视时代！
This isn't new anymore. This isn't life. This is bigger. This is television!

568
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:56,203
约翰逊一家已经被保护起来

你怎么描述埃里斯特・约翰逊现在的状态？
How would you characterize Earnest Johnson's state of mind?

571
00:47:03,043 --> 00:47:05,307
我能说的就是，他很饿

572
00:47:05,412 --> 00:47:06,538
他很饿
He was hungry.

573
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:08,682
那么，您现在看到的是
Well, there you have it.

574
00:47:08,682 --> 00:47:10,047
我再不给他小费了
I ain't tipping him anymore.

575
00:47:10,317 --> 00:47:12,979
我应该去修剪下哈蒂太太的榆树
I ought to trim Mrs. Hardy's elm.

576
00:47:13,687 --> 00:47:17,646
看起来像是快长到我们屋顶上了 你怎么看？
Looks like it's moving in our roof. What do you think?

577
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:21,085
很难说，你看呢？
Hard to tell. What do you think?

578
00:47:22,562 --> 00:47:23,324
确实是
Definitely.

579

几乎取代了吉哈德

581
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:02,629
老天！
Holy crap!

582

I got a friend down the road I want you to meet. You wanna go for a ride?

当然！我的女儿也能去吗？
Yes! Could my daughter come?

588
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:24,621
那样的话，或许你来开更好 随便你带什么！
In that case, maybe you'd better drive. Precious cargo and all!

Just a minute, Mr. Petty. Hey, Chubby!

有点像，像是长了翅膀的拖车

很不错的比喻，巴德

马蒂，就是我的＂莫莉＂

不介意我去看下作战指挥室吧，总统先生

- Andy? - Yeah.

638
00:51:34,981 --> 00:51:37,617
你肯定吗，因为那个人…

00:51:37,617 --> 00:51:40,177
我知道，这里有点太严肃了

总司令，管理整个国家什么的，请坐

641

644
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:54,958
啤酒？
A beer?

你可以去跟你的朋友说了
you're gonna have some story to tell your friends.

I read about you in the paper. They say you've never lost an election.

很对，从报纸上你可以读到很多
That's right. You can learn a lot from reading the newspaper.

654
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:31,294
他们也说你从来不相信任何事
They also said that you don't believe in anything anymore.

655
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:34,003
即使是出卖母亲的灵魂
Even if it meant selling your mother's soul.

656
00:52:34,073 --> 00:52:37,668
不是，你看，不是，那是恶意中伤 因为我母亲是个很伟大的…
No, see, no, see that's libelous, Because my mother is a wonderful...

657

660
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:04,361
呃，我是个美国人，对吧？
Well, I'm an American, aren't I?

661
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:08,264
在高中我偶尔会去玩
I played a little in high school.

662
00:53:08,775 --> 00:53:10,106
现在呢？打哪个位置？
Did you now? What position?

663
00:53:10,243 --> 00:53:11,232
我当四分卫
I was quarterback.

664
00:53:11,678 --> 00:53:16,377
我一直认为橄榄球是个战略游戏 跟外交很像
I always thought football was a strategic game. A lot like diplomacy.

665
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:20,119
你进攻，防卫 总统就像是你的四分卫…
You got your offense, your defense, the President is like your quarterback...

666
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:21,586
美国选民…
and the American voters...

667
00:53:22,388 --> 00:53:25,289
呃…他们就像教练
Well... they're like the coach.

668
00:53:27,227 --> 00:53:28,626
我没来没这样想过
Never thought of it that way.

669
00:53:28,695 --> 00:53:30,296
现在教练的职责就是确保…
Now the coach's job is to make sure...

670
00:53:30,296 --> 00:53:34,357
在球赛的关键时刻有合适的人控球
that the right man has the football at the critical time.

671
00:53:34,901 --> 00:53:36,869
我完全明白你说的，安迪
I know exactly what you mean, Andy.

672
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:38,498
是吗？
Do you?

673
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:42,239
也许还没有
Maybe not.

674
00:53:46,045 --> 00:53:47,205
请拿个球过来
Bring in the football, please.

675
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:51,049
巴德
Bud.

676
00:53:53,786 --> 00:53:54,844
你想控球吗？
You wanna hold the football?

677
00:53:56,556 --> 00:53:57,682
那里面装的是球？
There's a football in there?

678
00:54:02,996 --> 00:54:05,021
那个箱子里装的是启动密码…
That case holds the launch codes...

679
00:54:05,565 --> 00:54:07,396
用来启动美国核武器
to America's nuclear arsenal.

680
00:54:08,868 --> 00:54:10,301
那就是选举的目的
That's what this election's all about.

681
00:54:11,571 --> 00:54:16,599
启动密码就像…导弹之类的玩意儿？
Launch codes like... missiles and shit?

682
00:54:16,676 --> 00:54:20,112
我希望你把美国想象成一只队伍…
I want you to pretend that America is a team...

683
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:23,379
- 你是教练 - 好吧
- and you're the coach. - Okay.

684
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:27,153
假设现在是踢第四节比赛 我们正在控球，但是落后五分
Let's say it's the 4th quarter. We've got possession, but we're down by five.

685
00:54:27,153 --> 00:54:29,589
朝鲜已经进入我们的十五码线内…
North Korea has us pinned in our own fifteenth line...

686
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:34,526
危急时刻，你会怎么做？
with one second on the dooms day clock. What are you doing to do?

687
00:54:34,694 --> 00:54:39,757
没错，你要做决定 胜利和失败之间唯一的区别就是…
Okay, you go long. The only thing standing between victory and defeat...

688
00:54:40,266 --> 00:54:42,461
一次成功的投射，一次命中
is a successful Hail Mary. One play.

689
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:44,794
你会把球传给谁，巴德？
Who are you gonna give the ball to, Bud?

690
00:54:44,871 --> 00:54:48,207
你会把你的希望寄托在一些散漫的后补…
Do you pin your hopes on some liberal second string quarterback...

691
00:54:48,207 --> 00:54:51,438
上场都不超过五分钟的人身上吗？ 当然你不会
who hasn't had five minutes in the big show? Of course you don't.

692
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:54,844
你会作出明智的选择
You do the smart thing.

693
00:54:55,481 --> 00:54:59,085
唯一的事情就是 你需要派出最好的队员，这个队员…
The only thing. You go with your strongest arm, the man...

694
00:54:59,085 --> 00:55:01,019
能带你打赢整个赛季 他从来不会让你失望
who's carried you through the season, who's never let you down.

695
00:55:07,193 --> 00:55:09,661
巴德，美国人民的希望寄托在你身上
Bud, America's counting on you.

696
00:55:10,229 --> 00:55:13,858
是的，先生，我不会让他们失望的
Yes, sir. I'm not gonna let them down.

697
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,264
但是，这个
But, here.

698
00:55:18,171 --> 00:55:20,639
我不想弄这个
Wouldn't want to drop the old football.

699
00:55:21,507 --> 00:55:22,872
去炸法国或是其他什么地方的
Blow up France or something.

700
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:25,011
你打不开的
You couldn't.

701
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:29,641

01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,300
如果我被选为总统
If I'm elected President.

849
01:05:44,812 --> 01:05:45,301
什么？
What?

850
01:05:45,846 --> 01:05:48,280
不，准确告诉我他们说了什么

保护这个国家的野生环境是我的责任…
It's my commitment to protect the wild places in this country...

852

为了子孙后代

853
01:05:56,924 --> 01:05:58,721
我也不会只在这里做，巴德

这只能被形容为完全的政治逆转…
And what can only be characterized as a complete policy reversal...

859
01:06:47,775 --> 01:06:51,404
总统已经完全疏远了他的大赞助商…
the President has surely alienated his corporate donors...

860
01:06:51,479 --> 01:06:54,243
站在了保护环境一边
by adopting a pro-environment stance.

861
01:06:54,648 --> 01:06:56,550
巴德和莫莉・约翰逊今天也到场…

我们才是主张 保护环境的党啊！

863
01:06:59,553 --> 01:07:01,521
那些混蛋偷走了我们的政治纲领

我不认识，克拉姆先生
I don't know, Mr. Crumb.

870
01:07:19,573 --> 01:07:22,098
我喜欢那个叫卖的声音 很有节奏感

您的妻子不是我们的目标 那个婊子养的才是
Your wife's not our target demographic, that son of a bitch is.

874
01:07:33,854 --> 01:07:34,718
很好
Great.

875
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,683
他用特工把他圈起来了！
He's got the Secret Service running flight patterns!

876
01:07:45,132 --> 01:07:49,660
我们所要做的都要跟这个家伙有关
All we need is an issue that matters to this guy.

877
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:51,769
一个目标，一个人…

Right now, an '89 Chevy Silverado.

887
01:08:57,972 --> 01:09:01,373
你不需要把那个拿起来 不动它，效果更好
You don't have to lift that up. If you leave it, it's probably better.

888
01:09:01,442 --> 01:09:04,378
- 你错过了机会 - 我已经尽力了
- This thing is getting away from you. - I'm doing the best I can.

无数的遥控换台的声音

咔嗒就是完蛋！

01:09:47,454 --> 01:09:49,479
不是，是内雇
No, I mean in.

903
01:09:49,957 --> 01:09:51,992
- 能详细说下吗？ - 呃，嗯…
- Can you elaborate? - Yeah, well...

904
01:09:51,992 --> 01:09:56,053
我以前工作的地方，我认识一群人 他们被解雇了
where I used to work, there's a bunch of guys I know, they got laid off.

905
01:09:56,997 --> 01:10:01,235
不是把我们的活儿 把我们的活儿弄去墨西哥…
Instead of sending our jobs, losing our jobs to Mexico...

906

然后我们就被解雇了

等等，我能再说一遍吗？ 我想我说的不对

Border patrol?

913

那么，他们都是非法劳工？
So, they're actual undocumented workers?

914

01:15:38,138 --> 01:15:39,606
你说你去过德士古？
Did you say you went to Texico High?

992
01:15:39,606 --> 01:15:42,598
她去过，她姓莫拉莱斯
She did. Only her name was Morales.

993
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,106
莫拉莱斯？
Morales?

994
01:15:46,913 --> 01:15:52,749
开玩笑吧 你是鲍比・莫拉莱斯的一个妹妹？
You're kidding. One of Bobby Morales little sisters?

995
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:54,582
是啊，我就是
Yeah, that's me.

996
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:56,651
世界太小了！
Small world!

997
01:15:56,857 --> 01:16:00,293
镇子很小 那么，巴德，你准备好了吗？
Small town. Then, Bud, are you ready?

998
01:16:01,194 --> 01:16:01,922
现在可以吗？
It's a good time?

999
01:16:03,263 --> 01:16:04,787
呃，行啊，拍吧
Yeah, go ahead, shoot.

1000
01:16:19,146 --> 01:16:19,874
谢谢，巴德
Thanks, Bud.

1001
01:16:22,182 --> 01:16:25,049
咱们从同性恋结婚开始谈起吧
Why don't we get started with your opinion of gay marriage.

1002
01:16:25,118 --> 01:16:28,281
天！非谈这个吗？
Shit! Do we have to?

1003
01:16:28,355 --> 01:16:31,722
- 那么，你是反对了 -  我…没有，我没有那么说
- So, you're against it. - I... no, I didn't say that.

1004
01:16:32,059 --> 01:16:33,686
那么，你是什么态度？
Then, what is your position?

1005
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:38,498
我没意见，事实上，这对我不重要
I don't have a position on it. Actually, I don't give a rat's ass about it.

1006
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:42,965
我爸总是说国王在他的领地可以为所欲为
My daddy always said whatever a king does in his castle is his business.

1007
01:16:43,136 --> 01:16:47,197
所以我猜有两个皇后也没问题
I guess the same can go for two queens.

1008
01:16:52,879 --> 01:16:56,940
我是布恩总统 很高兴向你介绍我的一些朋友
I'm President Boone, and I'd like you to meet a few friends of mine.

1009
01:16:57,584 --> 01:17:00,144
他们是医生，治安官员
They're our doctors, and our peace officers.

1010
01:17:00,587 --> 01:17:03,886
他们教育我们的孩子 衷心地在军队服役
They teach our children, they serve nobly in our armed forces.

1011
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:06,259
长久以来，同性恋的美国人…
For two long, homosexual Americans...

1012
01:17:06,259 --> 01:17:08,284
一直在被他们热爱的国家所迫害
have been persecuted by the country they love.

1013
01:17:08,862 --> 01:17:14,095
作为总统，如果我再次连任的话 将会首先敞开大门
This President, if re-elected, will implement the open door initiative.

1014
01:17:14,601 --> 01:17:19,436
让同性恋的美国人，男性或女性 都能自豪地走出枷锁
Gay Americans alike will be able to proudly step out of the closet...

1015
01:17:19,573 --> 01:17:24,670
同样走向圣坛，交换彼此的誓言
and on to the alter, to exchange the sacred vows enjoyed by the rest of us.

1016
01:17:25,278 --> 01:17:29,683
巴德，有了你的帮助 共和党的政府…
Bud, With your help, this Republican administration...

1017
01:17:29,683 --> 01:17:32,982
将会赞成同性婚姻
will say, I do. To gay marriage.

1018
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:34,851
我愿意
I do.

1019
01:17:37,757 --> 01:17:38,451
我愿意
I do.

1020
01:17:39,092 --> 01:17:40,024
我愿意！
I do!

1021
01:17:40,627 --> 01:17:41,719
我愿意
I do.

1022
01:17:41,862 --> 01:17:42,794
我愿意！
I do!

1023
01:17:44,397 --> 01:17:45,591
我愿意！
I do!

1024
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:53,169
- 我成功了！ - 就是那样，宝贝！
- I did it! - That 'a way, baby!

1025
01:17:54,774 --> 01:17:58,073
当我们还是小孩儿的时候 这是周末唯一能玩的
When we were kids, this was the only thing to do on the weekends.

1026
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:00,911
现在也是
Still is.

1027
01:18:12,826 --> 01:18:14,020
好球，巴德
Well done, Bud.

1028
01:18:14,928 --> 01:18:15,485
看到了？
See?

1029
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:17,921
让我们谈一些现实的话题
Let's get to some real issues.

1030
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:20,324
好啊
Okay.

1031
01:18:20,934 --> 01:18:24,597
反对堕胎还是支持流产的合法化？ 你站在哪一边？
Pro-life or pro-choice? Where do you stand?

1032
01:18:26,706 --> 01:18:27,934
呃…
Well...

1033
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:33,810
生命很美好，现在也是
Life's pretty good. Right about now.

1034
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:35,511
所以，你反对堕胎了？
So, you're pro-life then?

1035
01:18:39,052 --> 01:18:39,848
谁不是呢？
Who isn't?

1036
01:18:42,656 --> 01:18:43,179
阿蒂
Artie.

1037
01:18:46,326 --> 01:18:47,850
- 阿蒂 - 干嘛？
- Artie. - What?

1038
01:18:48,695 --> 01:18:53,066
我感觉不对，我们走错方向了
I don't feel comfortable with this. We're headed in the wrong direction.

1039
01:18:53,066 --> 01:18:54,397
不是，这很好
No, it's gonna be great.

1040
01:18:54,601 --> 01:18:56,398
- 阿蒂 - 开始！开始！
- Artie. - And action! Action!

1041
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,935
开始，唐纳德！
And action, Donald!

1042
01:19:02,809 --> 01:19:04,003
我们的未来是什么？
What is our future?

1043
01:19:04,477 --> 01:19:06,570
我会告诉你我们的未来是什么
I'll tell you what our future is.

1044
01:19:07,113 --> 01:19:10,350
这些孩子，跟你的女儿一样，巴德
Children like these, like your daughter, Bud.

1045
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:13,444
快乐，自由，充满希望
Happy, free, full of promise.

1046
01:19:14,521 --> 01:19:18,787
但是想象一个没有了这些欢声笑语的世界
But imagine a world without all this joyous laughter.

1047
01:19:19,559 --> 01:19:21,220
我指的是堕胎
I'm talking about abortion.

1048
01:19:21,795 --> 01:19:24,831
布恩总统，他说他反对堕胎
President Boone, he claims he's pro-life.

1049
01:19:24,831 --> 01:19:26,333
但是在他的领导下…
But yet under his leadership...

1050
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:30,531
还没能做出任何实质上的贡献 来改变罗诉韦德法案
no significant challenge has been leveled against Roe versus Wade.

1051
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:33,540
有了你的帮助，巴德 格林利夫的政府…
With your help, Bud, the Greenleaf administration...

1052
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:38,443
将会尽一切努力改变这种非人道的法案
will lead a genuine effort to reverse this inhumane court decision.

1053
01:19:38,678 --> 01:19:43,274
所以，加入我和民主党吧 我们会保护所有生命…
So, join me and the Democrats as we preserve all life...

1054
01:19:44,384 --> 01:19:47,911
这是在延续上帝的杰作
That's for filling God's intelligent design.

1055
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:51,289
我是唐纳德・格林利夫 我坚持这个立场
I'm Donald Greenleaf and I approve this message.

1056
01:19:51,558 --> 01:19:53,321
看起来不对啊
That don't seem right.

1057
01:19:54,227 --> 01:19:57,025
他这样说是因为你说你不喜欢堕胎
He's only saying that because you said you didn't like abortion.

1058
01:19:57,197 --> 01:19:59,062
呃，但是我并没有那么说
Yeah, but I didn't say that.

1059
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:01,199
你告诉她你选择生命优先权
You told that you were pro-life.

1060
01:20:02,769 --> 01:20:03,394
那又怎么样？
So what?

1061
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:07,463
选择生命优先就是反对堕胎 罗诉韦德法案？嘿！
Pro-life means anti-abortion. Roe versus Wade? Hello!

1062
01:20:08,174 --> 01:20:09,334
真搞不懂你
This isn't working.

1063
01:20:09,843 --> 01:20:12,641
我还以为有帮助呢，结果更糟
I thought would help, but it's just worse.

1064
01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:14,646
是你要我跟她聊的
You're the one that wanted me to talk to her.

1065
01:20:14,714 --> 01:20:17,842
我以为你会喜欢她，她聪明，而且人很好…
I thought you might like her. She's smart, and nice...

1066
01:20:17,984 --> 01:20:20,077
不像以前跟你鬼混的那些女人
not like the other women you spend time with.

1067
01:20:23,757 --> 01:20:25,452
哪些女人，莫莉？
Which women would those be, Molly?

1068
01:20:25,925 --> 01:20:27,620
跳舞的那个，巴德
The ones that dance, Bud.

1069
01:20:29,396 --> 01:20:31,227
呃，至少她们都有工作
Well, at least they got jobs.

1070
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,700
一切都乱了
It's all getting turned upside down now.

1071
01:20:36,236 --> 01:20:38,864
什么乱了？
What's all getting turned upside down?

1072
01:20:39,939 --> 01:20:41,668
你在毁灭美国！
You're ruining America!

1073
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:45,003
- 我什么？ - 你在毁灭美国！
- I'm what? - You're ruining EUA!

1074
01:20:45,078 --> 01:20:47,113
- 我在毁灭美国？ - 是的！
- I'm ruining EUA? - Yes!

1075
01:20:47,113 --> 01:20:47,636
什么？
What?

1076
01:20:49,082 --> 01:20:52,886
我只是走了点运…
What I finally am is having a little good luck...

1077
01:20:52,886 --> 01:20:54,649
是你给我的！
and you're giving me shit about it!

1078
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:00,718
你知道这些对我这样的人意味着什么吗？
You know what all this means for someone like me?

1079
01:21:02,128 --> 01:21:04,798
我也有过梦想，或许不是这个…
I had dreams once. Maybe it weren't this...

1080
01:21:04,798 --> 01:21:07,858
那是在五年级，我也有梦想
but I was in the fifth grade, so I had them.

1081
01:21:09,235 --> 01:21:09,929
现在呢…
And now...

1082
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:15,571
我都已经是个无名之辈了，可是…
I pretty much been headed on a road for being a nobody and now that...

1083
01:21:15,642 --> 01:21:19,874
我成名了 你却不能忍受我得到的一点关注
I am a somebody, you can't stand that I'm getting a little attention.

1084
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:23,178
- 一点？ - 是的，一点
- A little? - Yeah, a little.

1085
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:26,078
或许我应该说出事实，巴德
Maybe I'll tell the truth, Bud.

1086
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,080
- 事实？ - 是的
- The truth? - Yes.

1087
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,380
什么事实？
The truth about what?

1088
01:21:32,025 --> 01:21:35,791
也许我应该告诉每个人 是我在你喝醉的时候投的票！
Maybe I'll tell everybody it was me who tried to vote while you got drunk!

1089
01:21:36,162 --> 01:21:38,426
我不在乎他们会不会把我带走
I don't care if they take me away from you.

1090
01:21:38,498 --> 01:21:40,090
莫莉…嘿，莫莉！
Molly... Hey, Molly!

1091
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:43,529
让我自己待着
Leave me alone.

1092
01:21:49,976 --> 01:21:51,876
- 好吧 - 好吧
- Fine. - Fine.

1093
01:21:54,414 --> 01:21:55,039
好吧
Fine.

1094
01:22:47,467 --> 01:22:48,365
能签个名吗？
Could you sign it?

1095
01:22:50,403 --> 01:22:51,563
没问题，柯里
Sure thing, Curly.

1096
01:22:54,674 --> 01:22:59,134
嗨，巴德…你替我们亲了总统的屁股吗？
Hey, Bud... did you give the President's butt a kiss from us?

1097
01:23:04,317 --> 01:23:05,545
你想说什么，沃特？
You got something to say, Walt?

1098
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:11,855
不光是我，巴德 没有人喜欢你对镇子所做的事
It's not just me, Bud. No one likes what you done to this town.

1099
01:23:12,258 --> 01:23:14,158
你投票后都发生了什么呀？
What's gonna happen after you vote?

1100
01:23:14,494 --> 01:23:18,396
每个人都会卷铺盖走人 跟来之前一样
Everyone's gonna pack up and leave us in the same shape as they found us.

1101
01:23:18,565 --> 01:23:20,863
巴德，你上电视了！
Bud, you're on TVagain!

1102
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:26,673
嗨，巴德，你又上电视了
Hey, Bud, you're on TV again.

1103
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:28,800
人们不应该再说 巴德・约翰逊是民主的象征了
People have to stop saying Bud Johnson is good for democracy.

1104
01:23:29,175 --> 01:23:32,167
他让我们成了全世界的笑柄
He's made us the laughing stock of the entire world.

1105
01:23:32,312 --> 01:23:35,982
媒体像狗仔队一样跟在他屁股后面 因为…
The news media follows him around like a bunch of paparazzi, because...

1106
01:23:35,982 --> 01:23:38,314
我们更关注他是个新闻人物…
we're more concerned with his fifteen minutes of fame...

1107
01:23:38,485 --> 01:23:40,749
而不是他将做出的决定
than we are with the choice he's about to make.

1108
01:23:41,354 --> 01:23:43,345
真的有人在乎这个人吗？
Is anybody really listening to this guy?

1109
01:23:44,224 --> 01:23:48,160
清醒点吧，美国！ 巴德・约翰逊就是个笨蛋！
Wake up, America! Bud Johnson, is a dumbass!

1110
01:24:06,446 --> 01:24:08,641
您的妻子来了，格林利夫先生
Your wife has just arrived, Mr. Greenleaf.

1111
01:24:08,715 --> 01:24:10,444
感谢老天！太好了
Thank God! Good.

1112
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:13,112
请不要惹他不高兴
Please, don't upset him.

1113
01:24:13,653 --> 01:24:16,383
你什么时候来的？我太想你了！
When did you get in? I missed you so much!

1114
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:20,923
你就让这么一个二百五毁了你自己
You are letting this two bit hack destroy you.

1115
01:24:21,594 --> 01:24:24,898
你现在就是共和党指责的样子
You are everything that the Republicans accused you of being.

1116
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:27,867
懦弱的外行人，毫无立场
A spineless amateur. Afraid to take a position.

1117
01:24:27,934 --> 01:24:29,993
我不是害怕坚持立场
I am not afraid to take a position.

1118
01:24:31,437 --> 01:24:33,667
好吧，有时我有别的想法
Okay, sometimes I have second thoughts.

1119
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:35,931
但是哪一个有思想的人不是如此呢？
But what thinking person doesn't?

1120
01:24:36,042 --> 01:24:39,910
你以前是代表民主党的，你们俩
You used to stand for something. Both of you.

1121
01:24:40,647 --> 01:24:41,443
让她走吧
Let her go.

1122
01:24:42,315 --> 01:24:44,010
你怎么了，阿蒂？
What's happened to you, Art?

1123
01:24:44,517 --> 01:24:45,814
这次我会赢
I'm gonna win this time.

1124
01:24:46,119 --> 01:24:48,688
你以前也进行过有意义的宣传
You used to run campaigns that meant something.

1125
01:24:48,688 --> 01:24:53,751
如果我支持的候选人会赢的话 那就是有意义！
They would have meant something if the candidates I backed had won!

1126
01:24:55,028 --> 01:24:59,362
你知道拥有了所有理论是怎样吗？
You know what's like to be on the right side of every issue on the theory stage?

1127
01:24:59,766 --> 01:25:02,030
每次都是失望？
The hope that rocks with every loss?

1128
01:25:03,403 --> 01:25:06,270
这次不会，再也不会了
Not this time. Never again.

1129
01:25:19,352 --> 01:25:21,115
回去工作！每个人！
Back to work! Everybody!

1130
01:25:26,993 --> 01:25:28,790
看看！
Look at that!

1131
01:25:29,228 --> 01:25:32,095
你烤的热狗，刚刚好
You burnt the hot dog, just a little bit.

1132
01:25:32,599 --> 01:25:33,861
我就喜欢这样的！
Just the way I like them!

1133
01:25:36,402 --> 01:25:37,835
- 巴德？ - 呃？
- Bud? - Yes?

1134
01:25:39,172 --> 01:25:43,108
我想我们应该要求开一个总统辩论会
I think we should ask for a Presidential debate.

1135
01:25:45,378 --> 01:25:49,148
嗨！我们就不能谈点别的吗？
Come on! Can't we just talk about something else for one night?

1136
01:25:49,148 --> 01:25:51,173
就一分钟？也许？
Just for a minute? Maybe?

1137
01:25:53,252 --> 01:25:55,846
你刚跟我说的什么？
What did you just say to me?

1138
01:25:57,023 --> 01:26:00,481
总统辩论会，你可以提问
A Presidential debate. Where you get to ask questions.

1139
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:03,026
嗨，算了吧
Please. Just stop.

1140
01:26:03,162 --> 01:26:05,528
这很重要！这能帮你做决定
It's important! It could help you decide.

1141
01:26:05,598 --> 01:26:07,156
帮我做决定
Help me decide.

1142
01:26:08,067 --> 01:26:09,535
想想你都跟我说了什么
Think about what you're saying to me.

1143
01:26:09,535 --> 01:26:12,766
我有！你应该读读给你的来信
I have! You should read all this mail you've been getting.

1144
01:26:13,239 --> 01:26:15,139
人们写信给你寻求帮助
People are writing to you for help.

1145
01:26:15,608 --> 01:26:17,701
人们写信给我，那又怎样？
People are writing me letters. So what?

1146
01:26:18,211 --> 01:26:20,372
我帮不了他们
I can't help these people.

1147
01:26:22,315 --> 01:26:23,543
你可以为他们说话
You can speak for them.

1148
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:28,909
你能为我那么做吗？
Will you do it for me?

1149
01:26:35,128 --> 01:26:37,926
我做这些都是为了你！
I'm doing this all because of you!

1150
01:26:42,935 --> 01:26:46,496
我们刚刚确认 这周三晚有场总统辩论会…
Confirmed, one Presidential debate will occur this Wednesday night...

1151
01:26:46,973 --> 01:26:50,101
约翰逊先生会向每位候选人提问
at which Mr. Johnson will ask both candidates a set of questions.

1152
01:26:50,743 --> 01:26:53,075
第二天，他会再次投票
The following day, he'll cast his vote.

1153
01:26:57,450 --> 01:26:59,441
巴德，你会在辩论会上问什么？
Bud, what will you ask at the debate?

1154
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,956
事实是，我还不知道，但是我…
Truth is, I don't know yet, but I'm...

1155
01:27:05,491 --> 01:27:06,685
我会知道的
I'll figure it out.

1156
01:27:12,932 --> 01:27:15,628
我讨厌辩论，他们会耍诈
I hate debates. Where they try-to trick you.

1157
01:27:16,002 --> 01:27:17,970
我知道，但是你会没事的
I know, but you'll be fine.

1158
01:27:18,805 --> 01:27:20,830
我们有两天时间来把这事搞定
We have two days to sew this thing up.

1159
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:23,437
我需要你再见见巴德
I'm gonna need you to meet with Bud again.

1160
01:27:24,877 --> 01:27:27,778
然后，给他一点好处
And, offer him a little incentive.

1161
01:27:29,515 --> 01:27:31,574
你要我给他一袋钱？
You want I give him a bag of cash?

1162
01:27:31,718 --> 01:27:33,583
不行，太多人盯着呢
No, he's got too much attention on him for that.

1163
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,611
我在想也许你可以给他一份工作
I was thinking that maybe you'd offer him a job.

1164
01:27:37,156 --> 01:27:40,182
一些好处，你明白我的意思
Something with benefits. If you know what I mean.

1165
01:27:40,993 --> 01:27:42,688
马蒂，我正要跟你谈谈
Marty, I've been meaning to talk to you.

1166
01:27:44,831 --> 01:27:47,425
我不确信我们用在这个巴德身上的方法是不是可靠
I'm not sure about our strategy on this whole Bud thing.

1167
01:27:47,867 --> 01:27:51,064
你从来没质疑过我，任何事
You've never questioned me before. On anything.

1168
01:27:51,771 --> 01:27:52,294
从没
Ever.

1169
01:27:52,872 --> 01:27:56,831
我知道，我不是说我做不到，只是…
I know and I'm not saying I won't do it. I just...

1170
01:27:58,478 --> 01:27:59,945
我摆脱不掉这种感觉…
I can't shake this feeling...

1171
01:28:01,614 --> 01:28:04,481
我们改变立场的方式 而现在还要给巴德工作…
The way we've been switching positions, and now offering Bud...

1172
01:28:06,452 --> 01:28:08,420
我们只是在做我们一直都在做的事
We're just doing what we always do.

1173
01:28:10,556 --> 01:28:11,147
就是这样
That's all.

1174
01:28:11,924 --> 01:28:15,155
做我们该做的事情 争取我们该争取的选民
Dancing the dance, Courting the voters.

1175
01:28:16,696 --> 01:28:19,597
除了这一次，这次只有一个选民
Except this time, it's only one voter.

1176
01:28:21,434 --> 01:28:22,332
一个人
It's one guy.

1177
01:28:23,503 --> 01:28:25,334
这就是历史，总统先生
This is history, Mr. President.

1178
01:28:26,672 --> 01:28:28,264
以前从未发生过
It's never happened before.

1179
01:28:28,808 --> 01:28:32,938
这是全世界都会记住的一刻，永远记住
This is a moment the whole world will remember. Forever.

1180
01:28:35,448 --> 01:28:36,437
我明白了
I understand.

1181
01:28:43,289 --> 01:28:44,722
我们该怎么办？
What are we about?

1182
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:46,182
赢
Winning.

1183
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:51,396
因为如果我们不能赢的话 你就不能实现你的目标了
Because if we don't win, you can't do what you set out to do.

1184
01:28:52,365 --> 01:28:54,299
而你做过的一切，都会不算数
And what you've done, won't matter.

1185
01:28:55,034 --> 01:28:58,094
如果我们输了，就都完了
If we don't win, it's all over.

1186
01:28:59,272 --> 01:29:00,330
你也完了
And you're over.

1187
01:29:01,874 --> 01:29:02,499
巴德！
Bud!

1188
01:29:05,945 --> 01:29:06,707
巴德！
Bud!

1189
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:11,774
几点了？
What time is it?

1190
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:14,945
迟到了，迟到了 你答应过今天送我上学的
Late. It's late. You promised to take me in today.

1191
01:29:15,021 --> 01:29:18,787
好吧！等我几分钟
Okay! Just give me a few minutes.

1192
01:29:20,126 --> 01:29:22,651
今天什么日子？
What's today?

1193
01:29:24,697 --> 01:29:25,629
算了吧
Forget it.

1194
01:29:28,935 --> 01:29:30,732
你能送我吗？
Can you take me, please?

1195
01:29:33,306 --> 01:29:35,274
呃，好吧，我们走
Yeah Ye. Let's go.

1196
01:29:40,546 --> 01:29:41,570
噢， 老天！
Oh, God!

1197
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:46,441
嗨，等等，莫莉
Hey, wait a minute, Molly.

1198
01:29:54,427 --> 01:29:56,554
莫莉！莫莉！
Molly! Molly!

1199
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:59,564
约翰逊先生…约翰逊先生！
Mr. Johnson... Mr. Johnson!

1200
01:30:00,633 --> 01:30:02,260
总统想跟你谈谈
The President would like a word with you.

1201
01:30:02,902 --> 01:30:04,597
- 总统？ - 是的，先生
- The President? - Yes, sir.

1202
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,737
嗨，别那么无聊！
Hey, get a life!

1203
01:30:10,943 --> 01:30:14,071
在我被解雇之前我在吉尔摩上班
I used to work at Gilmore before I got laid off.

1204
01:30:14,814 --> 01:30:17,305
现在，我在找我能干的活儿
Now, I find work wherever I can.

1205
01:30:18,551 --> 01:30:20,849
给人除草，修东西
Mow people's lawns, fixing stuff.

1206
01:30:22,021 --> 01:30:23,113
不太容易
Hasn't been easy.

1207
01:30:26,525 --> 01:30:27,116
莫莉
Molly.

1208
01:30:29,929 --> 01:30:34,263
如果你爸爸能为我说句话的话 我会非常感激
I'd sure appreciate it if your Dad could put in a good word for me at the plant.

1209
01:30:35,635 --> 01:30:38,695
谢谢，麦克和埃弗雷特先生的…
Thank you, Michael and Mr. Everett for that...

1210
01:30:40,006 --> 01:30:40,995
演讲
presentation.

1211
01:30:42,308 --> 01:30:43,605
下一个？
Who's next?

1212
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,901
莫莉
Molly.

1213
01:31:01,727 --> 01:31:04,059
我想你们都已经认识我爸爸了
I guess you all probably know my dad.

1214
01:31:06,899 --> 01:31:08,890
他今天很想来的，但是…
He really wanted to be here today, but...

1215
01:31:10,536 --> 01:31:12,629
他有很多重要的事情要做
he had so many important things to do.

1216
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:16,332
他在尽力，但是…
He's doing his best, but...

1217
01:31:17,643 --> 01:31:19,474
他不能马上出现在每个地方
he can't be everywhere at once.

1218
01:31:22,281 --> 01:31:24,374
自从这事发生以后…
Ever since all this stuff happened...

1219
01:31:27,153 --> 01:31:29,348
他真的承担了很大的压力
he's really been under a lot of pressure.

1220
01:31:32,825 --> 01:31:34,588
我只是希望你们知道…
I just want you to know that...

1221
01:31:35,561 --> 01:31:38,428
他很认真地对待他的责任…
he takes his responsibilities seriously...

1222
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:43,602
他真的很关心穷人…
and that he really cares about helping poor people...

1223
01:31:44,236 --> 01:31:45,635
和病人
and sick people.

1224
01:31:47,373 --> 01:31:49,864
和那些无助的人
And people that can't help themselves.

1225
01:31:55,247 --> 01:31:55,872
我…
My...

1226
01:31:59,952 --> 01:32:03,012
我爸爸希望这个国家变得更美好
my dad wants to make this country a better place.

1227
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,965
你想过将来吗？巴德
Do you think much about your future?

1228
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:23,266
什么将来？
What future?

1229
01:32:24,844 --> 01:32:25,742
我知道你的意思
I know what you mean.

1230
01:32:26,445 --> 01:32:28,504
我们都担心我们的晚年
We all worry about the sun down years.

1231
01:32:29,348 --> 01:32:31,680
迟早，这些喧闹都会归于沉寂
Sooner or later, all this hoopla is gonna die down.

1232
01:32:31,951 --> 01:32:33,386
他们会为我建一个图书馆
They're gonna build me a library.

1233
01:32:33,386 --> 01:32:35,081
而你也不过是重新变回到芸芸众生
And you're gonna be just another face in the crowd.

1234
01:32:37,723 --> 01:32:38,587
就等着这一天呢
Can't wait.

1235
01:32:40,493 --> 01:32:42,188
你得考虑下生活保障了
What you need to think about is security.

1236
01:32:43,362 --> 01:32:44,522
我有个朋友…
Now I've got a friend...

1237
01:32:46,465 --> 01:32:50,629
可以给你份工作，在大厅里
who might have a job for you. In the lobby business.

1238
01:32:52,171 --> 01:32:54,799
就像给人开门的那种？
Like opening doors for people?

1239
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:56,773
你很聪明！
Very astute!

1240
01:32:57,309 --> 01:33:00,279
给政治家和支票开门
Open doors to politicians. And their checkbooks.

1241
01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:03,510
人们很喜欢你，巴德 他们觉得你是他们中的一员
People really like you, Bud. They feel like you're one of them.

1242
01:33:05,084 --> 01:33:06,915
我不是很懂，安迪
I'm not quite following you, Andy.

1243
01:33:13,325 --> 01:33:15,691
有时候你会想你一辈子想要什么
Sometimes you gotta figure out what you want in this life.

1244
01:33:17,196 --> 01:33:19,391
然后你会想这对你有多重要
Then you have to decide how much it's worth to you.

1245
01:33:20,599 --> 01:33:22,396
因为他们会在你的墓碑上写
Because they're gonna put it on your tombstone.

1246
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:25,337
这是你的遗产
It's your legacy.

1247
01:33:26,939 --> 01:33:28,873
看看你留下了什么
A measure of what you left behind.

1248
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:31,572
我们…
Are we...

1249
01:33:33,846 --> 01:33:35,609
我们能不能说下工作？
are we still talking about the job?

1250
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:39,749
大厅的工作？
The lobby business?

1251
01:33:42,588 --> 01:33:45,557
好吧，忘了它吧
Right. Forget that.

1252
01:33:50,029 --> 01:33:51,155
一点都不值
It's not worth it.

1253
01:34:00,539 --> 01:34:01,403
还有谢谢你
And thank you.

1254
01:34:36,008 --> 01:34:36,702
莫莉！
Molly!

1255
01:34:37,977 --> 01:34:40,002
你说过只要我想聊聊就找你，对么？
You said that if I ever wanted to talk, right?

1256
01:34:43,482 --> 01:34:44,744
热可可
Here's some hot cocoa.

1257
01:34:46,519 --> 01:34:48,510
抱歉，我只有脱脂牛奶了
Sorry. All I had was skim milk.

1258
01:34:48,754 --> 01:34:49,652
没关系
It's okay.

1259
01:34:52,725 --> 01:34:53,692
怎么了？
What's going on?

1260
01:34:55,327 --> 01:34:57,795
- 都是我的错 - 什么你的错？
- It's all my fault. - What's your fault?

1261
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:00,189
巴德本来放学后要来接我的
Bud was supposed to meet me after school.

1262
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:03,300
他知道这对我有多重要，但是他喝醉了
He knew how important it was to me. But he got drunk.

1263
01:35:04,069 --> 01:35:07,540
他根本没来，我不知道该怎么办！
He never even showed up. I didn't know what else to do!

1264
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,735
等等，莫莉，你在说什么？
Wait, Molly, what are you saying?

1265
01:35:11,677 --> 01:35:12,268
莫莉？
Molly?

1266
01:35:13,846 --> 01:35:14,938
你不接电话吗？
Aren't you gonna get that?

1267
01:35:16,382 --> 01:35:20,682
嗯，等我一会儿，待在这儿，我去挂电话
Yeah, give me two seconds. Stay here. I'm gonna get them off the phone.

1268
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:35,867
我再打给你？ 现在不是时候，是的，我知道
Can call you back? This isn't a good time. Yeah, I know.

1269
01:35:37,203 --> 01:35:38,761
我知道，你已经告诉我了
I know. You already told me that.

1270
01:35:46,812 --> 01:35:48,780
听着，我再打给你？
Look, can I call you back?

1271
01:35:49,481 --> 01:35:50,140
莫莉？
Molly?

1272
01:35:51,784 --> 01:35:52,478
莫莉！
Molly!

1273
01:36:08,801 --> 01:36:09,426
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1274
01:36:11,003 --> 01:36:12,994
你想你爸今晚会喝醉吗？
You think your dad might be passed out tonight?

1275
01:36:16,909 --> 01:36:18,968
你是说，你会重新投票
Then, you're going to recast your vote.

1276
01:36:19,078 --> 01:36:21,706
我猜这不是个秘密了，对吧？
I guess it ain't that much of a secret then, is it?

1277
01:36:25,451 --> 01:36:29,319
如果我们想重新创造历史 我们就得打破这个怪圈
If we are to be the exception to history, then we must break the cycle.

1278
01:36:29,922 --> 01:36:31,753
人们忘却历史…
For those who do not remember the past...

1279
01:36:33,759 --> 01:36:35,693
提醒我下谁在竞选？
Remind me again who's running?

1280
01:36:35,894 --> 01:36:38,260
所以，你是说，你仍然…
So, what you're saying is, you're keeping...

1281
01:36:38,731 --> 01:36:41,962
都是我的错，巴德本来放学后要来接我
It's all my fault. Bud was supposed to meet me after school.

1282
01:36:42,101 --> 01:36:45,332
他知道这对我有多重要，但是他喝醉了
He knew how important this was to me. But he got drunk.

1283
01:36:45,738 --> 01:36:49,071
他都没来，我不知道该怎么办！
He didn't even show up. I didn't know what else to do!

1284
01:36:49,341 --> 01:36:50,643
莫莉，你在说什么？
Molly, what are you saying?

1285
01:36:50,643 --> 01:36:51,632
他没有投票！
He didn't vote!

1286
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:56,181
失踪，你什么意思，她失踪了？
What do you mean, she's missing?

1287
01:36:56,181 --> 01:36:57,650
我很抱歉，约翰逊先生，都是我的错
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson. It's all my fault.

1288
01:36:57,650 --> 01:36:58,984
大声说，路易斯！
For crying out loud, Lewis!

1289

你们这些家伙可是保护总统的

她在给你回信
She's been answering your mail.

1294
01:37:25,811 --> 01:37:26,436
为什么？

1295

她希望人们以为你很关心他们
She wanted people to think that you cared.

1296

她告诉你的？
She told you that?

01:37:49,435 --> 01:37:52,563
约翰逊先生 莫莉有没有什么朋友我们可以联系的？

1298
01:37:52,638 --> 01:37:53,468

01:37:58,711 --> 01:38:01,805
没有，她不交朋友

- 是她告诉你的？ - 是的，先生

你知不知道她会去哪儿？

呃，我想我知道

情况变了
Things have changed.

1329

我快签唱片了
I'm close to getting a record deal.

1330
01:41:18,911 --> 01:41:20,776
两个月前我办了场演奏会
I did a gig a couple of months ago.

1331
01:41:21,079 --> 01:41:26,485
有人想让我联系一个 有名的纳什维尔制作人
This guy wants to put me in touch with this big time Nashville producer.

1332
01:41:26,485 --> 01:41:28,112
所以他会打电话给我的 我还没准备好
So he's gonna call me. I'm not gonna be ready.

I gotta get ready. There's a lot I gotta do, so I can't do this.

我会照顾你的，妈妈

我不需要别人照顾我，我不要你在这儿
I don't want anybody to take care of me. I don't want you here.

1337
01:41:46,204 --> 01:41:47,136
爸爸！
Dad!

1338
01:41:50,809 --> 01:41:52,470
老天，拉莉萨！

我不想她看到我这样
I don't want her to see me like this.

1340

莫莉，你去外面，听话？ 出去等我，你出去等我
Molly, you gotta go outside, okay? For me. You got out there and wait.

1341
01:41:59,217 --> 01:42:02,015

1344
01:42:18,337 --> 01:42:19,104
很难解释
I can't explain.

1345
01:42:19,104 --> 01:42:23,336
你想怎么样，现在出名啦？ 你想来接我？不行！
What are you, famous now? You think you can just come? I can't do this!

1346
01:42:23,442 --> 01:42:26,605
- 等等… - 不要！不要！待在那儿
- Wait... - No! No! Come here.

1347
01:42:26,878 --> 01:42:28,180
我没疯拉莉萨
I'm not mad Larissa.

1348
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:29,374
站住！我告诉你…
I'm trying to tell you...

1349
01:42:29,781 --> 01:42:33,585
我现在不能当妈，不能，后退！我不能…
I can't be a mom right now. I can't. Stay back! I can't...

1350
01:42:33,585 --> 01:42:37,578
现在当妈，我不能，我不能
be a mom right now. I can't do it. I can't do it.

1351

说了不见记者的，路易斯

我没时间，凯特

So as much as I'd love for you to make an ass out of me again on TV...

我知道选举那晚发生的事

我报道的故事，我只是想确保我知道的是真相
I'm running the story. I just want to make sure I've got my facts right.

01:44:25,764 --> 01:44:29,632
酒保说你7：30离开的斯塔林
The bartender claims you left the Starline about 7:30.

1363
01:44:30,268 --> 01:44:30,962
对吗？
Is that correct?

1364
01:44:31,737 --> 01:44:32,499
是的，小姐
Yes, madam.

1365
01:44:32,938 --> 01:44:36,135
你有足够的时间去投票站接莫莉…
Giving you plenty of time to meet at the polling station...

1366
01:44:37,008 --> 01:44:38,066
并投下一票…
and cast your vote...

1367
01:44:38,710 --> 01:44:39,267
对吧？

1368

1369

我很抱歉，有个东西给你

有那么一会儿忘了我是谁

你能帮我吗，今晚帮他？

1376
01:45:12,210 --> 01:45:14,974
我干两份工，只为了养家糊口
I work two jobs just trying to make ends meet.

1377
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:17,149
去年我的儿子被诊断为…

立法者为低收入的艾滋病人更新了主要项目

各位晚上好
Good evening everyone.

1381
01:46:47,772 --> 01:46:51,105
我们在一个美国小镇为您做现场报道…
We come to you live from a small American town...

1382
01:46:51,610 --> 01:46:54,943
一个几个月前从未听说过的小镇
a town most of us had never heard of just a few weeks ago.

1383
01:46:55,146 --> 01:46:57,282
一个在地图上找不到的小镇…
A town you couldn't find on the map...

1384
01:46:57,282 --> 01:47:00,740
因为以前地图上 没有新墨西哥州的德士古镇
because Texico, New Mexico, wasn't on the map.

1385
01:47:01,453 --> 01:47:02,818
但是现在有了
But it's on the map now.

1386
01:47:02,888 --> 01:47:06,688
全世界都在关注这个镇上历史性的一刻
The whole world has descended on this town for an historic event.

1387
01:47:06,825 --> 01:47:09,726
一个与众不同的政治辩论
A political debate unlike any other.

1388
01:47:09,861 --> 01:47:12,455
明天早上，埃里斯特・巴德・约翰逊…
Tomorrow morning, Earnest Bud Johnson...

1389
01:47:12,530 --> 01:47:15,192
将会去投票站做出他的选择
will walk into a voting booth and make a choice.

1390
01:47:15,734 --> 01:47:20,865
他的选择将影响我们的未来
And his choice will affect our lives for generations to come.

1391
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:25,102
赌注不能再高了，你怎么看？
The stakes could not be higher. What do you expect?

1392
01:47:25,176 --> 01:47:29,044
我在想，亚伦，我们国父们的意愿是什么
I wonder, Aaron, what the founding fathers would make of all this.

1393
01:47:29,247 --> 01:47:32,944
他们是感到羞辱，还是会欢呼雀跃？
Would they be mortified, or would they be jumping for joy?

1394
01:47:33,084 --> 01:47:36,315
有种感觉告诉我现在在某个地方…
Something tells me that somewhere right now...

1395
01:47:36,488 --> 01:47:40,948
富兰克林和杰弗逊正在看着我们并朝我们微笑
Franklin and Jefferson are looking down and smiling.

1396
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:42,883
微笑还是嘲笑？
Smiling or laughing?

1397
01:47:43,061 --> 01:47:45,063
我不知道是不是在微笑
I don't know if they're smiling.

1398
01:47:45,063 --> 01:47:48,396
约翰逊可不是他们想要的 来选美国总统的人
That's not exactly who they had in mind for picking the President of the USA.

1399
01:47:48,566 --> 01:47:53,060
我们关注的这个人 就我来看的话，还是一团糊涂
We're sending someone out there who really is, as far as, we can tell lost.

1400
01:47:53,204 --> 01:47:56,367
他能突然找到感觉吗，在今晚的台上…
Can he find himself suddenly, tonight on this stage...

1401
01:47:56,508 --> 01:47:58,874
还是看起来像是个马戏团的小丑？
Or is he going to look like a rodeo clown down there?

1402
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:03,174
今晚，全国都在观看 我们和您一同关注
Tonight, the whole country is watching and we watch with you.

1403
01:48:04,182 --> 01:48:05,513
我想吐
I'm gonna puke.

1404
01:48:05,583 --> 01:48:07,642
巴德，看着我，看着我
Bud, look at me. Look at me.

1405
01:48:08,286 --> 01:48:11,016
好好表现，你会很棒的
Just be yourself. You're gonna be great.

1406
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,986
嗨，爸爸记得，不要说粗话！好吗？
Hey, remember dad. No cussing! Okay?

1407
01:48:18,463 --> 01:48:19,987
- 好的 - 好
- Fine. - Fine.

1408
01:48:20,966 --> 01:48:22,900
约翰逊先生，还有一分钟
Mr. Johnson, one minute, please.

1409
01:48:26,204 --> 01:48:27,102
好运！
Good luck!

1410
01:48:31,743 --> 01:48:32,903

01:48:33,345 --> 01:48:36,212
大家都就座了，我们就去舞台上…
The crowd has settled down and we go to the stage...

1412
01:48:36,281 --> 01:48:37,748
看看据说是…
for what promises to be...

1413
01:48:38,283 --> 01:48:42,481
美国政治史上最独特的一幕
one of the most unique moments in American political history.

1414
01:49:25,897 --> 01:49:28,457
总统先生，格林利夫先生…
Mr. President, Mr. Greenleaf...

1415
01:49:29,634 --> 01:49:33,035
我很感谢你们的款待，非常有意思
I'd like to thank you for your hospitality. It's been real interesting.

1416
01:49:33,905 --> 01:49:36,499
我曾说过一些原非本意的话
I've said a lot of thing I didn't mean.

1417
01:49:37,308 --> 01:49:38,810
你们也都做出了很多承诺…
And you both made a lot of promises...

1418
01:49:38,810 --> 01:49:40,437
那些不会实现的承诺
you probably won't be able to keep.

1419
01:49:49,821 --> 01:49:52,847
老实说，过去的十天就像是个奇怪的梦
To be honest, the last 10 days have felt like a weird dream.

1420
01:49:53,691 --> 01:49:55,852
有些好笑的东西，已经都不好笑
What was once kinda funny, isn't anymore.

1421
01:49:57,729 --> 01:49:58,923
报纸上都说，我…
From what I've read, I've...

1422
01:50:01,099 --> 01:50:03,499
呃，我让整个美国都捏了一把汗
well, I've scared the hell out of America.

1423
01:50:04,469 --> 01:50:07,870
我知道整个世界都在看着我们 或许还在嘲笑
I know that the world is watching, maybe even laughing.

1424
01:50:08,339 --> 01:50:10,432
电视上的人说…
People on my own TV, are saying...

1425
01:50:10,708 --> 01:50:13,939
美国，无论如何，值得拥有这一刻
that America, somehow, deserves this moment.

1426
01:50:15,914 --> 01:50:17,211
想想那是指我吧
Guess that means me.

1427
01:50:20,085 --> 01:50:24,044
我不能说我的一生有多么重要
I can't say that I've been much of anything most of my life.

1428
01:50:24,122 --> 01:50:26,852
就像一路走来到达某一处…
It's sorta like somewhere along the way...

1429
01:50:27,859 --> 01:50:31,696
我仔细回想 我没有过很大的梦想
I checked out and it's not like I had big dreams to begin with.

1430
01:50:31,696 --> 01:50:34,722
但我曾经也有过追求
But I had something once.

1431
01:50:35,934 --> 01:50:40,805
有过类似信念或者希望，不管怎样…
I had something close to faith or hope or whatever...

1432
01:50:40,805 --> 01:50:43,239
任何你们用来描绘美好生活的词
whatever word you want to use for how good life could be.

1433
01:50:45,076 --> 01:50:49,547
但是，时间开始流逝，然后突然…
But then, the years start moving quicker and all of a sudden...

1434
01:50:49,547 --> 01:50:51,481
每个人都幸福满满…
what's going good out there for every else...

1435
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,674
但你却不是
isn't going so good for you.

1436
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:58,887
但是，今晚我感觉…
But, tonight I feel...

1437
01:51:00,725 --> 01:51:01,623
很难堪
embarrassed.

1438
01:51:05,063 --> 01:51:07,429
我也有过很多很多的机会
I've had my chances, more than most.

1439
01:51:08,733 --> 01:51:10,325
我生长的这个国家…
I've grown up in a country where...

1440
01:51:10,668 --> 01:51:14,866
如果我这一生多做点正事 而不是游荡酗酒的话…
if I decided to do more with my life than just drift and drink...

1441
01:51:15,373 --> 01:51:16,965
那么我也可能站在…
that I could be standing where...

1442
01:51:18,576 --> 01:51:20,237
你们今晚所站的位置
where maybe you stand tonight.

1443
01:51:21,012 --> 01:51:24,914
然而，我随意索取却毫无贡献
Instead, I've taken freely and I've given nothing.

1444
01:51:26,151 --> 01:51:27,618
我很惭愧在我的…
I'm ashamed in front of my...

1445
01:51:29,521 --> 01:51:30,146
女儿面前
daughter.

1446
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:34,516
还有我的国家面前
And my country.

1447
01:51:36,628 --> 01:51:38,830
我从没有付出或者牺牲过
I've never served or sacrificed.

1448
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:43,267
要求我做的也都是些简单的事情，比如…
The only heavy lifting I've been asked is simple stuff, like...

1449
01:51:43,601 --> 01:51:46,832
集中精力，投票…
pay attention. Vote...

1450
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:51,031
为了美国能有一个…
For America has a...

1451
01:51:53,011 --> 01:51:55,946
如果美国今晚真有一个敌人的话 我想那是我
if America has a true enemy tonight, I guess it's me.

1452
01:51:58,516 --> 01:52:02,509
今晚，一个浪荡子 将要在两位精英中做出选择
Tonight a below average man is going to choose between two exceptional men.

1453
01:52:03,488 --> 01:52:05,979
明天，一个人的投票将会改变一切…
Tomorrow, one man's vote is going to make a difference...

1454
01:52:07,358 --> 01:52:09,189
＂因为明天我们将会有一名总统
"Cause tomorrow we're gonna have a President.

1455
01:52:09,494 --> 01:52:12,088
不只是为了填满华盛顿的位置
And not just someone to fill a chair in Washington.

1456
01:52:13,798 --> 01:52:16,323
我们需要一个不光只会演说的人
We need someone who's bigger than their speeches.

1457
01:52:17,302 --> 01:52:20,965
而是那种我们在学校就学习到的总统
The kind of President we learned about in school.

1458
01:52:23,107 --> 01:52:24,768
美国需要一个伟大的思想家
America needs a big thinker.

1459
01:52:27,145 --> 01:52:29,204
你们知道的，像个巨人那样，真的
You know, like a giant, really.

1460
01:52:29,547 --> 01:52:32,710
一个能真正解决问题的人
Someone who has the good sense to get in front of our problems.

1461
01:52:33,184 --> 01:52:36,354
一个用智慧带领我们到达…
Somebody who has the wisdom to lead to us a place...

1462
01:52:36,354 --> 01:52:38,720
和平之地的人
where we're at peace with ourselves and the world.

1463
01:52:40,692 --> 01:52:43,957
为了记录，我希望你们…
And just for the record, I want you both...

1464
01:52:45,196 --> 01:52:47,994
我希望你们知道我很慎重地在做选择
I want you both to know that I think a hella lot of you.

1465
01:52:58,843 --> 01:53:03,280
今晚，我将为我素未谋面的人发言…
Tonight, I am going to speak for people I have never met...

1466
01:53:06,417 --> 01:53:09,318
他们的来信不可思议地触动了我
whose letters touched me in a way I didn't think was possible.

1467
01:53:12,557 --> 01:53:14,525
我的第一个问题来自…
My first question comes from...

1468
01:53:14,826 --> 01:53:16,953
肯塔基州，亨德逊的皮特・曼利斯
Peter Manthis, in Henderson, Kentucky.

1469
01:53:17,362 --> 01:53:18,556
＂亲爱的约翰逊先生…
"Dear Mr. Johnson...

1470
01:53:18,763 --> 01:53:21,425
我妻子和我有三个小女儿
my wife and I have three little girls.

1471
01:53:21,499 --> 01:53:25,060
我们都打两份工来养家糊口
We both work two jobs just trying to make ends meet.

1472
01:53:26,704 --> 01:53:29,298
但是几周前，我们做不到了”
And some weeks, we don't make it."

1473
01:53:30,008 --> 01:53:32,877
＂当你努力工作但仍不能养活全家的时候…
"When you work hard and you still can't take care of your family...

1474
01:53:32,877 --> 01:53:36,506
作为一个家庭支柱，作为一个男人 你会开始质疑你自己
you start to question yourself as a provider, as a man.

1475
01:53:37,649 --> 01:53:40,846
我知道我就是这样一个人 我为我的国家努力工作，我也很骄傲
I know I am one. I fought for my country and I'm proud of it.

1476
01:53:42,553 --> 01:53:46,922
但是我不敢想 要是有个孩子生病了该怎么办
But it scares me to think about what would happen if one of my kids got sick.

1477
01:53:48,559 --> 01:53:52,996
＂你能不能问问候选人 如果我们是世界上最富有的国家…
"Can you ask the candidates, if we are richest country in the world...

1478
01:53:54,499 --> 01:53:57,491
为什么还有很多人像我一样不能生存呢？＂
how come some many of us can barely afford to live here?"

1479
01:54:00,605 --> 01:54:03,096
如果可以的话我先回答吧，格林利夫先生
I'd like to take that one first, if I might, Mr. Greenleaf.

1480
01:54:04,175 --> 01:54:05,472
请吧，总统先生
Answer, Mr. President.

1481
01:54:07,712 --> 01:54:11,614
巴德，首先我想说 我很欣赏你的深思
Bud, I'd first like to say, how much I appreciate your thoughtfulness.

1482
01:55:29,712 --> 01:55:40,614
谢谢观赏！
